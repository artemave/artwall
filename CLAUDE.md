# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A standard-library-only Python tool that sets a random painting from
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) (every `instance of: painting` that has an
image — ~400k) as the **Sway** desktop wallpaper. The painting is composed (via
ImageMagick) onto a display-sized canvas so it's shown *whole* (no cropping); the
letterbox margins are filled with a soft gradient sampled from the painting's own
colours, and a caption (artist/title/date) is burned into the corner. It's a
**oneshot** — sets the wallpaper once and exits. Rotation is driven by Sway
events, not a daemon: the Sway config subscribes to window-focus events and runs
artwall on each, with `--throttle` (using `Config.min_interval`) limiting it to
~every 30 min. Launched
as a child of Sway, it inherits `SWAYSOCK` — no systemd, no env import. No
third-party Python dependencies — keep it that way (use `urllib`, not
`requests`); external CLI tools (`swaymsg`, `magick`) are fine since we already
shell out.

## Commands

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests   # run all tests
python3 -m unittest tests.test_app      # run one module
python3 -m unittest tests.test_app.RunTests.test_happy_path_sets_wallpaper  # one test
make install-dev                        # dev tooling: ruff, mypy, coverage
make check                              # all checks: lint + typecheck + 100%-coverage-gated tests
make lint / make typecheck / make test / make coverage  # individual targets (configs: ruff.toml, mypy.ini, .coveragerc)
python3 -m artwall                       # set the wallpaper once (hits network + swaymsg + magick)
python3 -m artwall --throttle            # set once, but no-op if changed < Config.min_interval ago (event throttle)
```

## Architecture

The entry point is intentionally thin; all logic lives in importable modules so
it can be tested without network or `swaymsg`.

- `artwall/config.py` — `Config` dataclass holding cache paths and the Wikidata
  endpoints (`sparql_url` for WDQS, `api_url` for the Action API, `commons_url`
  for images) plus `ids_ttl`. **This is the test seam:** tests build a `Config`
  pointing at a temp dir and a local HTTP server. Don't hardcode paths/URLs
  elsewhere.
- `artwall/cache.py` — JSON load/save + `fresh()` (mtime-based TTL).
- `artwall/web.py` — low-level HTTP (`get_json`, `get_text`, `download`) over
  `urllib`, with a Wikimedia-compliant User-Agent and an `accept` arg (WDQS picks
  its result format — JSON vs CSV — from the `Accept` header, not a query param).
- `artwall/wikidata.py` — **pure** source logic: build the catalogue SPARQL
  (`catalogue_query`) and parse its CSV (`parse_catalogue`); parse an Action-API
  entity into image-filename/creator/title/year (`parse_entity`) and read a
  `label`; build the sized Commons image URL from a filename (`image_url` →
  `Special:FilePath/<file>?width=`). Prefer adding source logic here. **Two
  services on purpose:** WDQS (`sparql_url`) is outage-prone, so it's used *only*
  for the monthly catalogue; every per-painting fetch goes to the stable Action
  API.
- `artwall/selection.py` — **pure** `caption` formatting (artist/title/date).
- `artwall/commands.py` — pure argv builders for `magick` (the gradient-canvas
  compose + caption) and `swaymsg`.
- `artwall/app.py` — orchestration. `run(config, rng, runner, get_outputs,
  throttle)` injects `rng`, `runner`, and `get_outputs` (defaulting to `random`,
  `subprocess.run`, and `sway_outputs`) so the full flow can be driven
  deterministically.

Flow in `run()`: if `throttle` and `config.stamp` was touched more recently than
`config.min_interval`, return early (the event-driven throttle). Otherwise:
fetch/cache the catalogue (one SPARQL query → all painting QIDs as a CSV of bare
ints) → query the active outputs (`get_outputs`, default `sway_outputs()` →
`swaymsg -t get_outputs`; each is an `Output` carrying name + pixel size) → for
each display, pick a random QID and fetch its image filename + title/date via the
Action API (`wbgetentities`), then a second `wbgetentities` for the creator's
name (retry up to `ATTEMPTS` only to skip a QID that has since lost its image),
build and download a width-capped Commons thumbnail, `magick`-compose it onto an
`Output`-sized gradient canvas (whole painting + caption) at
`current-<output>.jpg`, `swaymsg output <name> bg … fill` (a 1:1 blit, since the
canvas is already the display's size) → touch `config.stamp`. Selection is plain
random — no persisted history — but QIDs already chosen this run are excluded so
each display gets a *different* painting. The pick/download/compose step is
`_render()` (takes the target width/height), also used by `preview()` (the
`--preview` flag), which composes at a default 1920x1080, writes `preview.jpg`,
opens it with `xdg-open`, and leaves the wallpaper untouched.

`sway_outputs()` is the one function excluded from coverage (`# pragma: no
cover`) — it needs a live Sway compositor; its JSON parsing (name +
`current_mode` size) is split into the pure, tested `parse_outputs()`. All state
is cached under `~/.cache/artwall/`; deleting it is a safe reset.

## Testing conventions

No mocks (per the repo's global rule). Achieved by:
- Pure functions tested directly.
- The HTTP layer tested against a **real** loopback server (`tests/server.py`,
  `serve(router)`) standing in for Wikidata.
- `run()` tested with a real seeded `random.Random` and a `Recorder` callable
  that captures argv instead of executing `magick`/`swaymsg`.

When testing anything that does IO, follow this pattern (local server +
injected `runner`/`rng`) rather than reaching for `unittest.mock`.

## Deployment notes

No installer and no systemd. The user adds two lines to their Sway config: one
`exec` to set a wallpaper at startup, and one that subscribes to window events
and runs artwall per event with `--throttle` (see README). `bin/artwall`
is a small shell launcher that sets `PYTHONPATH` to the repo and execs `python3
-m artwall "$@"` — nothing more. A failed run prints to Sway's stderr and is
skipped; it doesn't touch the stamp, so the next event retries. Because the
process is a child of Sway it inherits `SWAYSOCK`, so `swaymsg` works with no
environment import (`swaymsg` talks to the IPC socket, it does not need
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`). Nothing is pip-installed, so the checkout must stay put — the
`exec` line points at it.

There is no long-running process of ours — rotation is event-driven and
self-throttled via `config.stamp`'s mtime, so the only persistent process is the
stock `swaymsg -t subscribe` pipe in the Sway config.
